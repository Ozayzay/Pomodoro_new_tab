# Get Shit Done - Pomodoro Focus Extension üçÖ

A minimalist Pomodoro timer Chrome extension with site blocking capabilities. I needed a focusing app that did exactly what I wanted without the bloat, subscriptions, or limitations of existing solutions - so I built this.

## Why I Built This

Every productivity app I tried was either:

- Behind a paywall for basic features
- Overcomplicated with unnecessary features
- Didn't block sites the way I wanted
- Had poor UI/UX that distracted from actual work

This extension does exactly what I need: **simple Pomodoro timing + effective site blocking + clean interface**.

## Features

### üéØ Core Functionality

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Customizable focus (25min) and break (5min/15min) sessions
- **Site Blocking**: Automatically blocks distracting sites during focus sessions
- **New Tab Override**: Replaces Chrome's new tab with your productivity dashboard
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual GitHub-style contribution grid showing daily focus time
- **Daily Stats**: Track how many hours you've focused each day

### üö´ Smart Site Blocking

- Sites are **only blocked during focus sessions**
- Automatically unblocks during breaks
- Easy to add/remove sites from blocklist

### Site Blocking Logic

- Uses Chrome's `declarativeNetRequest` API for efficient blocking

- Shows focus levels with color coding (0-6+ hours)
- Data persists across browser restarts

### Timer State Management

- State is synchronized across all extension pages
- Timer continues running even if dashboard is closed
- Visual and audio notifications when sessions complete

## Permissions Explained

## Troubleshooting
